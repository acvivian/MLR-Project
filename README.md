Fitting multiple linear regression models for BMI from 2010 to 2018. 
- The steps followed include:
- Data preprocessing: Transformation for skewness, Handling missing values using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
- Fitting multiple linear regression models for each BMI year using predictor variables like age, lifestyle factors (Lsat) etc.
- Evaluating the regression models using summary statistics and interpreting the significance of predictor variables based on p-values.
- Performing model diagnostics for each regression model: Residual Plots, Normal Q-Q Plot and Durbin-Watson Test
- Overall, the linear regression models for BMI reveal varying levels of significance for different predictor variables across different years.
